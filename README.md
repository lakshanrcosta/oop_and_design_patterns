# Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns Course

Welcome to the OOP and Design Patterns learning repository! This course covers essential software engineering concepts
that every developer should master.

## Course Overview

This course covers four main areas:

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Learn the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming:

- **Classes and Objects**: Building blocks of OOP
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and access control
- **Inheritance**: Code reuse through class hierarchies
- **Polymorphism**: One interface, multiple implementations
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details

### 2. SOLID Principles

Master the five principles that make code maintainable and scalable:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

Understand how objects interact and communicate:

- Strategy Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Template Method Pattern
- State Pattern

### 4. Design Patterns

Learn proven solutions to common programming problems:

- Creational Patterns (Factory, Builder, Singleton)
- Structural Patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
- Behavioral Patterns (Strategy, Observer, Command)

## Repository Structure

Each topic will have its own package with practical examples and explanations:

```
src/bcs/oop/
â”œâ”€â”€ runtime_polymorphism/     # Runtime Polymorphism Example
â”œâ”€â”€ solid_principles/         # SOLID Principles Examples
â”œâ”€â”€ behavioral_patterns/      # Behavioral Design Patterns
â””â”€â”€ design_patterns/          # Common Design Patterns
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to specific topic packages
3. Read the README.md files in each package for detailed explanations
4. Run the example code to see concepts in action

## Learning Path

1. **Start with OOP fundamentals** - Understand classes, objects, and the four pillars
2. **Apply SOLID principles** - Learn to write maintainable code
3. **Explore behavioral patterns** - Master object interaction patterns
4. **Study design patterns** - Learn industry-standard solutions

Happy Learning! ðŸš€
